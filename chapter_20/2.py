# Youâ€™re writing a function that accepts an array of distinct integers from 0, 1, 2, 3...up to N. 
# However, the array will be missing one integer, and your function is to *return the missing one*.

# For example, this array has all the integers from 0 to 6 but is missing the 4:
# [2, 3, 0, 6, 1, 5]
# Therefore, the function should return 4. 

# The next example has all the integers from 0 to 9 but is missing the 1:
# [8, 2, 3, 9, 4, 7, 5, 0, 6]
# In this case, the function should return the 1.

# Using a nested-loops approach would take up to O(N^2). Your job is to optimize the code so that it has a runtime of O(N).
